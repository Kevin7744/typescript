How the development processs works
- works in ts
- the code ins complied/converted in javascript
- ts is a development tool, just a layer on top of javascript



Types:
- Number, String, Boolean, 
- Null, Undefined, Void
- Object, Array, Tuples, ...
- Any, Never, Unknown

Basic Syntax:
- we use let for declaring variable
```
let varibaleName: type = value
```
